# --- cmake/enable_sanitizer.cmake ---
#
# Defines fls_enable_sanitizers(<target>) to apply
# AddressSanitizer, UBSan, and related checks on all builds
# *except* fully‐static macOS executables, which are unsupported,
# and on Win32 where Clang’s sanitizers aren’t reliably supported.
#
# RATIONALE:
#   • ASan on Apple platforms is provided only as a dynamic
#     runtime (libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib).
#   • Clang docs state: “Static linking of executables is
#     not supported.”
#   • On macOS-14 (Sonoma) & macOS-15 (Ventura), a truly
#     static binary with -fsanitize=address will abort at
#     startup (you see the shadow-byte legend then “ABORTING”).
#   • Linux “static” builds still load the dynamic libasan,
#     so only macOS static+ASan fails.
#   • On **Win32**, neither MSVC nor Clang-on-Windows reliably
#     supports the standard `-fsanitize=` flags by default:
#       – MSVC uses a different sanitization framework
#         (AddressSanitizer on Windows is still experimental).
#       – ODR-use of sanitizers can break the CRT linkage.
#     Disabling on Win32 avoids build errors and linkage issues.
#
# IMPACT ON CI:
#   OS         | Shared        | Static
#   -----------------------------------------
#   Ubuntu     | ✅ ASan       | ✅ ASan
#   macOS-14   | ✅ ASan       | ❌ Abort at startup
#   macOS-15   | ✅ ASan       | ❌ Abort at startup
#   Windows    | 🚫 Sanitizers | 🚫 Sanitizers
